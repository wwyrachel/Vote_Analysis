Level 1 Question 2

This question is make use of the percentage of the individual vote of each president candidate to 
create a histogram.

First, I will separate the voting data into 6 parts according to the states. I will make use of the 
data I have calculated in question 1 to create the histogram. For example, in FL state the votes 
DOn4ld get is 149, the votes Hil4ry get is 160 and the votes Nameless get is 143. To calculate the 
percentage, DOn4ld get 27.5% (149/541*100%), Hil4ry get 29.4% (160/541*100%) and Nameless 
get 26.4% (143/541*100%) so all of them are rounded to 20% . The vote other states are also calculated
in this method. 

Secondly, I will use scanf function to scan the names of the six states and print them on the chart 
as the x- axis.
