Level 1 Question 1

Firstly, I have define the data types of all variables and also initialize all the variable count to zero.

Secondly, I have use a file pointer and the fopen built in function to open and read the file name dataset.txt.

Thirdly, I have use serval for loops to read the data. The first for loop is the read the candidate names, 
the second for loop is to scan the states and the state vote for calculation.

Fourthly, I have use a while loop with condition that when it is not the end of file, such that the loop 
will keep accessed if it is not end of file.

Fifthly, in the while loop i have used three if condition sentences and some nested sentences to calculated 
the vote each candidate get. I have divided that into three parts with respect to the three candidates. 
Inside each if loop, I have further divided into 6 parts in order to count the votes each candidate get 
in each state. To calculated the votes I have use a function strstr() in string.h to see if a string is 
included in a line of the input file. If yes then the counting variabe will be increase by one.
  
After geting all the individual votes of each candidate, I will use these number to multiply the state votes 
and then divided by the number of people in each state such that the total number of votes of each 
candidate is calculated.

Finally, I have use an if statement will condition if the number of total votes Hil4ry get is larger than
DOn4ld get then print out "Hil4ry wins!" else print out "DOn4ld wins!".
